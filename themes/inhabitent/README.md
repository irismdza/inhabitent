#Summary

Inhabitent: a multi-paged, hipster-themed camping supply shop made with PHP and Wordpress as a content management system.

#Specifications
. Fixed-width website
. Made with custom page templates, post types, archives, taxonomies, fields, widget plugins, functions, loops, and a custom screenshot
. Made with dash icons
. Use of WP template hierarchy
. Use of Gulp for build tasks
. Use of Sass as preprocessor 
. Has toggle-able search form using JavaScript
. Has navigation bar with reversing colour scheme on scroll using jQuery

#Challenges
Understanding the WP template hierarchy was quite confusing at first, but the biggest challenge of this project was actually structuring the SCSS in the most effective and efficient manner. 

#Takeaways
Proper planning makes a huge difference on how a multi-page site is built out. Plotting the structure of page templates as well as the CSS to keep code as DRY as possible is definitely a skill I want to improve upon through more practice.
